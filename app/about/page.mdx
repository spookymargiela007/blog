I owe much of my career to the internet. I've spent the last decade in marketing, studying growth and scaling revenue ($30M+) for ad agencies, venture-backed startups, and enterprise companies. 

Now, I spend most of my time building things, learning from titans of business, and exploring tech frontiers (applied generative artificial intelligence). 

I'm the founder and CEO of **[Parallel AI](https://withparallel.ai)**, an early-stage startup building ambient AI agents to replace human Google Ads teams, a Partner at **[Colderatti](https://colderatti.com)** bringing the next-generation of cold plunge technology to market, and consult across various business stages and verticals.

And today, while words like obsession, bliss, wealth-creation, insecurity, exploration, and purpose do well to describe my reason for doing, my story begins with a simpler more formative discovery which I'll gladly share personally, should you ask.

What drives me is an instinctual hunger to improve pattern recognition and learning across domains. 

This same pattern recognition reveals both market dislocations and human behavioral potential while "curiosity" manifests as prescience but is actually first-principles pre-meditation.

I bought NVIDIA stock in 2016, bought Bitcoin at ~$3,000 and prototyped with GPT-3 before most knew of the breakthrough. These weren't strokes of luck, but conclusions drawn from studying natural convergence and acting before the world catches up. 

Further more, I adore leverage, money, product, corporation, psychology, merchantilism, and the art of solving meaningful problems. 

Whether it's spotting undervalued assets, identifying emerging technologies, or scouting talent. The benefactor is fundamentally about learning to calibrate signal from noise across complex systems.

Study systems deeply, identify inflection points early, and act with conviction when others hesitate. True leverage comes from seeing what wants to happen before it becomes obvious to everyone else.



## Stats and track-record

- I contributed to [MooTools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MooTools) as part of their core team and led the development of the MooTools Forge package repository.
- Authored one of the first books on Node.js ([&ldquo;Smashing Node.js: JavaScript Everywhere&rdquo;](https://www.amazon.com/Smashing-Node-js-JavaScript-Guillermo-Rauch/dp/1119962595)), after identifying the potential for JS to run on both server and client.
- My previous startup [LearnBoost](https://learnboost.com/) was one of the earliest adopters of Node.js in production. We made critical contributions to projects in the ecosystem like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect), [Jade](https://github.com/dscape/jade), [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/), and many others.
- Authored [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), which remains the most popular way of accessing MongoDB data in the JavaScript ecosystem.
- Authored [Socket.IO](https://socket.io), a popular library for real-time communication. Its underlying [engine](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io) powers Notion&rsquo;s realtime sync and the first Coinbase trading product.
- Authored [Hyper](https://github.com/vercel/hyper), a cross-platform Terminal emulator built on Web technologies with over 42,000 daily active developers.
- Designed and co-authored [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the most popular React framework. I later introduced it at the [ViennaJS meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxFfUs6sYnw) and [React Conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evaMpdSiZKk).
- I collaborated with [Shu Ding](https://shud.in/) on the design and conception of [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/).
- Built a popular file-sharing platform called [Cloudup](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/21/cloudup-is-a-fast-dead-simple-way-to-share-and-view-files-on-any-platform-without-the-folders/), building on [realtime infrastructure for MongoDB](https://github.com/Automattic/mydb) I authored inspired by Firebase and a proprietary predecessor to Electron for cross-platform Web-based desktop apps.
- Conceived and co-authored a turn-based, multi-player virtual machine running a copy of Windows XP [that went viral](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/windows-xp-virtual-machine/), inspired by [Twitch plays Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon).
- Authored several other popular, smaller utilities that have accumulated billions of downloads, like [ms](https://github.com/vercel/ms), [wifi-password](https://github.com/rauchg/wifi-password), [spot](https://github.com/rauchg/spot) and [slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin).
