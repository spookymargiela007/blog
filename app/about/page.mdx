I owe much of my career to the internet. I've spent the last decade in marketing, studying growth and scaling revenue ($30M+) for ad agencies, venture-backed startups, and enterprise companies. 

Now, I spend most of my time building things, learning from titans of business, and exploring tech frontiers. 

I'm the founder and CEO of **[Parallel AI](https://withparallel.ai)**, an early-stage startup building ambient AI agents to replace human Google Ads teams, own **[ColdPlungeTubs.com](https://coldplungetubs.com)** where I'm currently working with a U.S manufacturer to bring the Mercedes of cold plunge tubs to market, and consult across various business stages and verticals.

While you could use words like obsession, joy, insecurity, exploration, and purpose to understand what drives me in hindsight, my story itself begins with a simpler, more formative discovery.

I stopped out of business school at 20 and shortly after discovered Google Ads. I became obsessed with the proverbial real-world money printer as I saw it, $1 invested -> returned $4 or $44, so I spent 12-18 hours a day that summer learning how to multiply money on the platform. 

This white-rabbit encounter started me down the hole of advertising, where I learned on a spectrum from the legendary David Ogilvy to the sensational Gary Vaynerchuk. But while they taught me the craft of persuasion and attention, I soon realized the most valuable skill I was acquiring wasn't about marketing at all. It was the ability to deconstruct complex systems, find the underlying patterns, and teach myself anything I cared enough to understand.

The real transformation of my life wasn't about the tactics I learned—it was about the fundamental shift in how I understood leverage itself. The mentors who shaped my thinking—Naval Ravikant, Tim Ferriss, Tony Robbins, Lewis Howes, and Tom Bilyeu—taught me that success isn't about working harder; it's about working through systems that scale exponentially beyond your time and effort
