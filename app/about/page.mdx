I owe much of my career to the internet. I've spent the last decade in marketing, studying growth and scaling revenue ($30M+) for ad agencies, venture-backed startups, and enterprise companies. 

Now, I spend most of my time building things, learning from titans of business, and exploring tech frontiers (applied generative artificial intelligence). 

I'm the founder and CEO of **[Parallel AI](https://withparallel.ai)**, an early-stage startup building ambient AI agents to replace human Google Ads teams, a Partner at **[Colderatti](https://colderatti.com)** bringing the next-generation of cold plunge technology to market, and consult across various business stages and verticals.

Today, while words like obsession, bliss, wealth-creation, insecurity, exploration, and purpose do well to describe my reason for doing, my story begins with a simpler more formative discovery which I'll gladly share, should you ask of course.

What drives me is an instinctual hunger to improve pattern recognition and learning across domains. 

This same pattern recognition reveals market dislocations to human behavioral potential, a "curiosity" others mistake for prescience but is manifest first-principles pre-meditation.

I bought NVIDIA stock in 2016, bought Bitcoin at ~$3,000 and prototyped with GPT-3 before most knew of the breakthrough. These weren't strokes of luck, but conclusions drawn from studying natural convergence and acting before the world catches up. 

Furthermore, I adore leverage, money, product, corporation, psychology, merchantilism, and the art of solving meaningful problems.

Whether it's spotting undervalued assets, identifying emerging technologies, or scouting talent, the benefactor is fundamentally about learning to calibrate signal from noise across complex systems.

Add to intuition, identify inflection points early, and act with conviction when others hesitate. True leverage comes from seeing what wants to happen before it becomes obvious to everyone else.
